I cannot generate a JPG image file as I can only generate text-based code. Image files are binary assets that need to be created using image editing software or downloaded from image sources.

For the task requirement "Activities and enrichment programs image - Creative or recreational activities image from Unsplash", you should:

1. **Visit Unsplash.com** and search for terms like:
   - "children activities"
   - "kids learning"
   - "creative activities"
   - "art class children"
   - "enrichment programs"

2. **Download a suitable image** that shows:
   - Children engaged in creative or recreational activities
   - Educational enrichment activities
   - Art, music, or hands-on learning

3. **Optimize the image** for web:
   - Resize to appropriate dimensions (e.g., 800x600px or 1200x800px)
   - Compress to reduce file size (aim for under 200KB)
   - Save as JPG with 80-85% quality
   - Ensure proper licensing (Unsplash provides free-to-use images)

4. **Place the file** at: `src/images/program-activities.jpg`
